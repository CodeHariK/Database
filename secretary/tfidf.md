TF-IDF and BM25: Concepts & Differences

TF-IDF and BM25 are information retrieval techniques used to rank documents based on their relevance to a query. They are commonly used in search engines, chatbots, and text analysis.

1. TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)

TF-IDF is a statistical measure that evaluates how important a word is in a document relative to a collection (corpus) of documents.

1.1. How TF-IDF Works
	1.	TF (Term Frequency)
	‚Ä¢	Measures how often a word appears in a document.
	‚Ä¢	Formula:
Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúapple‚Äù appears 3 times in a document of 100 words ‚Üí TF = 3/100 = 0.03.
	2.	IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)
	‚Ä¢	Measures how unique or rare a word is across all documents.
	‚Ä¢	Formula:
Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	If ‚Äúapple‚Äù appears in 10 out of 1000 documents:
Ôøº
	3.	TF-IDF Score Calculation
	‚Ä¢	The final score is:
Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	If TF = 0.03 and IDF = 2, then TF-IDF = 0.03 √ó 2 = 0.06.

1.2. Uses of TF-IDF
	‚Ä¢	Search engines (Google, Elasticsearch)
	‚Ä¢	Keyword extraction
	‚Ä¢	Text classification

2. BM25 (Best Matching 25)

BM25 is an improved version of TF-IDF that introduces additional parameters to adjust for document length and term saturation. It‚Äôs widely used in modern search engines.

2.1. How BM25 Works

BM25 improves TF-IDF by:
	1.	Adjusting Term Frequency (TF) with Saturation
	‚Ä¢	In TF-IDF, if a word appears 100 times, it gets 100 times the weight.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 limits the effect of repeated words using a saturation function.
Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	k‚ÇÅ is a tuning parameter (usually 1.2‚Äì2.0).
	‚Ä¢	This prevents a single frequent word from dominating the ranking.
	2.	Length Normalization
	‚Ä¢	Long documents naturally contain more words.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 normalizes document length using a parameter b (0 ‚â§ b ‚â§ 1).
Ôøº
	‚Ä¢	If b = 1, normalization is fully applied.
	‚Ä¢	If b = 0, no length normalization is applied.
	3.	BM25 Score Calculation
Ôøº
where:
	‚Ä¢	t is the term.
	‚Ä¢	IDF(t) is computed like TF-IDF.
	‚Ä¢	k‚ÇÅ and b are hyperparameters.

2.2. Why BM25 is Better than TF-IDF
	‚Ä¢	Better ranking accuracy (avoids giving too much weight to very frequent words).
	‚Ä¢	Handles long documents better (prevents bias against short documents).
	‚Ä¢	More flexible with parameters (you can tune k‚ÇÅ and b for different datasets).

2.3. Uses of BM25
	‚Ä¢	Search engines (Elasticsearch, Apache Solr, Lucene)
	‚Ä¢	Document ranking (Wikipedia, PubMed search)
	‚Ä¢	Question answering systems (Chatbots)

3. TF-IDF vs. BM25: Key Differences

Feature	TF-IDF	BM25
Formula	Multiplicative (TF √ó IDF)	More advanced with saturation & normalization
Handles Long Documents?	No	Yes (length normalization)
Handles Frequent Terms?	No	Yes (TF saturation)
Weighting	Linear scaling	Saturated scaling
Customization	No parameters to tune	k‚ÇÅ and b can be adjusted
Use Case	Simple text analysis	Advanced search ranking

4. When to Use Which?
	‚Ä¢	Use TF-IDF when:
	‚Ä¢	You need a quick, simple ranking method.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre working on small datasets (like keyword extraction).
	‚Ä¢	You don‚Äôt have control over ranking parameters.
	‚Ä¢	Use BM25 when:
	‚Ä¢	You need high-quality search rankings.
	‚Ä¢	You‚Äôre working with large-scale datasets (search engines, knowledge bases).
	‚Ä¢	Document length varies significantly.

5. Conclusion
	‚Ä¢	TF-IDF is simple and effective for basic keyword weighting.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 improves upon TF-IDF by handling document length variations and term saturation, making it better for real-world search engines.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 is widely used in modern search engines like Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene.

Why Lucene Uses BM25 Instead of TF-IDF

Apache Lucene is a powerful text search library used in Elasticsearch, Solr, and OpenSearch. It switched from TF-IDF to BM25 as its default ranking function because BM25 provides better search relevance.

1. How Lucene Uses BM25

Lucene uses BM25 to rank search results by computing a score for each document based on how well it matches a given query. The ranking formula is:

Ôøº

Where:
	‚Ä¢	TF(t) ‚Üí Term frequency (how many times term t appears in a document)
	‚Ä¢	IDF(t) ‚Üí Inverse document frequency (importance of t across all documents)
	‚Ä¢	|doc| ‚Üí Length of the document
	‚Ä¢	avgDocLength ‚Üí Average length of all documents
	‚Ä¢	k‚ÇÅ and b ‚Üí Hyperparameters (default: k‚ÇÅ = 1.2, b = 0.75)

2. Why Lucene Switched from TF-IDF to BM25

Lucene originally used TF-IDF, but it had limitations in real-world search ranking. The main problems with TF-IDF were:

2.1. Overemphasis on Term Frequency
	‚Ä¢	TF-IDF problem ‚Üí If a word appears many times in a document, it gets a very high weight.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 solution ‚Üí Uses saturation, meaning extra occurrences of a term add diminishing value.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	TF-IDF: A document with ‚Äúapple‚Äù 100 times gets 100√ó weight.
	‚Ä¢	BM25: A document with ‚Äúapple‚Äù 100 times gets limited extra weight (because of TF saturation).

2.2. No Document Length Normalization in TF-IDF
	‚Ä¢	TF-IDF problem ‚Üí Long documents are unfairly penalized because they have more words.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 solution ‚Üí Normalizes scores based on document length.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	A short article (300 words) and a long article (3000 words) might discuss ‚ÄúLucene‚Äù equally.
	‚Ä¢	TF-IDF favors the short document (high term density).
	‚Ä¢	BM25 adjusts scores fairly by normalizing for document length.

2.3. Better Tuning for Different Use Cases
	‚Ä¢	TF-IDF problem ‚Üí No tuning parameters.
	‚Ä¢	BM25 solution ‚Üí k‚ÇÅ and b can be adjusted based on the dataset.
Example:
	‚Ä¢	News search (where long documents matter) ‚Üí Set b = 0.75 (normal length normalization).
	‚Ä¢	Short document search (tweets, forum posts) ‚Üí Set b = 0.25 (less normalization).

3. Real-World Benefits of BM25 in Lucene

‚úÖ More relevant search results ‚Üí BM25 ranks important documents better.
‚úÖ Handles long documents better ‚Üí Fair scoring for long vs. short content.
‚úÖ Reduces bias from frequent words ‚Üí TF saturation prevents one word from dominating.
‚úÖ More configurable ‚Üí You can tweak k‚ÇÅ and b for different datasets.

4. BM25 in Elasticsearch and Solr
	‚Ä¢	Elasticsearch 5.0+ and Solr 7+ both use BM25 by default (instead of TF-IDF).
	‚Ä¢	You can still switch back to TF-IDF if needed, but BM25 generally performs better.
