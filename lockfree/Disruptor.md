LMAX Disruptor: High-Performance Concurrency Framework

The LMAX Disruptor is a lock-free, high-performance inter-thread messaging library designed for low-latency and high-throughput applications. It was created by LMAX, a financial exchange handling millions of transactions per second.

* Lock-Free Design: Avoids traditional locks (mutexes) and instead uses memory barriers & ring buffers.
* Single Writer Principle: Only one thread writes to a given section of the ring buffer at a time.
* Wait Strategies: Uses busy spin, yielding, or sleeping to optimize latency.
* Predictable Performance: Eliminates contention issues found in queues or shared memory models.
* Ultra-Low Latency: Sub-microsecond event processing.
